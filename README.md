This is a fork from the original repository here https://github.com/Mardaneus86/futwebapp-tampermonkey and updated for FIFA23 !

FIFA 23's companion app for FIFA Ultimate Team, the FUT 23 Web App, is a website that let's you trade and manage your team on the go.

This TamperMonkey script is meant to enhance the FUT 23 Web App experience. You can install the script following the instructions below. 

:warning: Using this script is at your own risk. EA might (temp-)ban you for altering parts of their Web App.

:bangbang: Do not request autobuyer features. Because they are considered to be cheating, it will not be added.

You can donate to the original creator for his hard work :beers: :+1:
